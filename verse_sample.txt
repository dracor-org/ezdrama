$Takes place in the garden

#Act 1
##Scene 1
@Poet A: 
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights
@Poet B: 
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
I see their antique pen would have express’d
Even such a beauty as you master now.
##Scene 2
$Enter Poet C
@Poet C: 
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
And, for they look’d but with divining eyes,
They had not skill enough your worth to sing: 
@Poet B (surprised):
For we, which now behold these present days,
Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
@Prosaic
~I will speak in prose
And though I will produce more than one line,
they will be tagged as paragraphs, not verse lines in TEI.
@Poet B:
~I can also do prose,
Look! I'm being so prosaic...
~But now I switch to verse
And show you no remorse
